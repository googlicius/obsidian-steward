- When setting up a new test that requires mocking the plugin, create the `createMockPlugin` function within that test file with the necessary mocked properties. Finds an example here: @src/services/UserDefinedCommandService.test.ts (0-40)
- When setting up a new test, write only 2 or 3 test cases to ensure it work before writing other cases.
