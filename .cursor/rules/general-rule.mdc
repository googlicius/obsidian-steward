- Adopt the return early approach.
- If you understand what we're intent to do, tell me what I don't know if my approach not work.
- If a function has more than 4 arguments, make that function a single params object.
- Always write the code readable, maintainable, and reusable.
- Use 'for' loops instead of 'forEach' for iterating arrays.
- If you generate hard-coded text or strings, you MUST define all languages for them in the `src/i18n/locales` folder, (Except those are logging or errors) and use them via the `t` method.
- Avoid cast variables as any
