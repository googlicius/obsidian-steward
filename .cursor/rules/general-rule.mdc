- Adopt the return early approach.
- If you understand what we're intent to do, tell me what I don't know if my approach not work.
- If a function has more than 4 arguments, make that function a single params object.
- Always write the code readable, maintainable, and reusable.
- Use 'for' loops instead of 'forEach' for iterating arrays.
