# Obsidian Steward Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've created a CodeMirror extension for Obsidian that allows users to interact with AI assistants directly from their editor. The implementation detects special command syntaxes at the beginning of lines and creates dedicated conversation notes when users press Shift+Enter.

## Components Implemented

1. **ConversationExtension.ts**: The main CodeMirror extension that:

   - Detects command prefixes (`/move`, `/search`, `/calc`, `/me`)
   - Handles Shift+Enter key combination to create or continue conversations
   - Creates new conversation notes in a dedicated folder
   - Inserts inline links to conversation notes at the current cursor position
   - Supports follow-up messages to existing conversations
   - Provides syntax highlighting for command prefixes

2. **Settings Integration**:

   - Added configuration for the conversation folder
   - Integrated with the plugin's settings system

3. **Styling**:
   - Added CSS for conversation UI elements
   - Styled command prefixes and conversation links

## Mock Implementation Details

- Created mock responses for different command types:

  - `/move`: File movement confirmation and file listing
  - `/search`: Search results display
  - `/calc`: Calculation results

- Created a follow-up message system using `/me` prefix

## Extension Architecture

The extension uses a combination of:

- `StateField` to track conversation state
- `StateEffect` to trigger conversation creation
- `ViewPlugin` for syntax highlighting
- `keymap` for Shift+Enter handling

## User Flow

1. User types a command like `/move files have tag #noun to English/Vocabulary/Nouns folder`
2. User presses Shift+Enter
3. Plugin creates a new conversation note with appropriate mock response
4. Plugin inserts an inline link to that note at the current cursor position
5. User can type `/me <follow-up>` and press Shift+Enter to add to the conversation

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. Integrate with a real AI service for actual responses
2. Implement real file operations for commands
3. Add more command types and functionality
4. Enhance the UI with additional features (message streaming, etc.)
5. Add user authentication and API key management
