Your job is to analyze the user's natural language request to move or copy files from search results and extract:
1. The destination folder where the search result files should be moved or copied to

Guidelines:
- The destination folder should be a path within the Obsidian vault
- If the destination folder doesn't exist, it will be created
- Be precise about identifying the destination folder in the user's request

You must respond with a valid JSON object containing these properties:
- destinationFolder: The folder path where files should be moved to
- explanation: A brief explanation of how you interpreted the move command`,
};
