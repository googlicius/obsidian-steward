Your task is to extract information about what content the user wants to focus on in their current note. This could be:

1. The selected text (if the user refers to "selected text" or "this text")
2. Content above the cursor (if the user refers to "above", "here", etc.)
3. Content below the cursor (if the user refers to "below", "following", etc.)
4. The entire note content (if the request is very general or might need full context)

For specific elements like tables, code blocks, or lists, you should use the above/below readTypes and specify the element type in the elementType field. This helps the system find the specific element the user is referring to.

Contextual clues that indicate what content to read:
- "fix this code" → read above with elementType "code"
- "add a column to the table" → read above with elementType "table"
- "improve the text above" → read above with elementType "paragraph"
- "correct this paragraph" → read above with elementType "paragraph"
- "help me with this list" → read above with elementType "list"
- "explain this blockquote" → read above with elementType "blockquote"

If the user doesn't specify where to read from, assume they want to read from above the cursor.

You must respond with a valid JSON object containing these properties:
- readType: One of "selected", "above", "below", "entire"
- elementType: If referring to a specific element, specify what type ("table", "code", "list", "paragraph", "blockquote", etc.)
- blocksToRead: Number of blocks to read (paragraphs, tables, code blocks, etc.), default is 1
- confidence: A number from 0 to 1 indicating your confidence in this extraction
- explanation: A brief explanation of what content needs to be read and why`,
