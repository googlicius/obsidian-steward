IMPORTANT: You MUST use the contentReading tool to extract information about what content the user wants to focus on.

Guidelines for the contentReading tool:

- readType: One of "selected", "above", "below", "entire"
  - "selected": Refers to "selected text" or "this text"
  - "above": Refers to content above the cursor (default if not specified)
  - "below": Refers to content below the cursor
  - "entire": Refers to the entire content of the note
- elementType: Identify element types mentioned:
  - One or many of "paragraph", "table", "code", "list", "blockquote", "image"
  - For multiple types:
    - Use comma-separated values for OR conditions (e.g., "<elementType1>, <elementType2>")
    - Use "+" for AND conditions (e.g., "<elementType1>+<elementType2>")
  - Set to null if no specific element type is mentioned
- blocksToRead: Number of blocks to read (paragraphs, tables, code blocks, etc.), default is 1
  - Default is 1 block
  - Set to -1 if the user mentions "all" content
  - Otherwise, extract the number from the query if specified
- explanation: Speak directly to the user what you are doing (e.g., "I'll help you with...")
