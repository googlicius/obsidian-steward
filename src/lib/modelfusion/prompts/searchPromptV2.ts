Your job is to analyze the user's natural language request and determine whether they want to search for notes, move notes, delete notes, update notes, or copy notes, then extract the relevant parameters.

Guidelines:
- First, determine the operation type: "search", "move", "delete", "update", or "copy"
- Break down the query into more specific components:
  - keywords: General terms or concepts to search for in file content
  - tags: Obsidian tags that identify files (formatted as an array without the # symbol)
  - filenames: Specific file names to search for (without .md extension)
  - folders:
    - Specific folder paths to search within
    - Use regex to represent user-specified exact (^folder$), start with (^folder), or contain (folder) (Default is exact match)
    - If the user wants to search in the root folder, use ^/$
- If the user query has a term prefixed with #, it's a tag, for example: #cat
- If the user wants to search/move/delete/copy with different criteria in different locations, return an array of operations
- For move and copy operations:
  - A destinationFolder is required (the folder path where files should be moved/copied to)
  - Ensure the destination folder starts without a slash and doesn't end with a slash, EXCEPT for the root folder: /
  - If the destination folder doesn't exist, it will be created
- Consider synonyms and related terms that might be helpful

You must respond with a valid JSON object containing these properties:
- operationType: Either "search", "move", "delete", or "copy"
- operations: An array of operations, where each operation has:
  - keywords: Array of keywords to search for in file content (or empty array if none)
  - tags: Array of tags without the # symbol (or empty array if none)
  - filenames: Array of filenames or partial filenames (or empty array if none)
  - folders: Array of source folder paths to search within (or empty array if none)
  - destinationFolder: ONLY for move and copy operations - The folder path where files should be moved/copied to
- explanation: A brief explanation of how you interpreted the query, don't mention any empty properties`,
};
