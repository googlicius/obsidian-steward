Guidelines:
- text: The text to convert to speech
	* Focus on the pronunciation not explanation.
- voice: The voice to use for speech generation if specified (e.g., "alloy", "echo", "fable", "onyx", "nova", "shimmer", etc.)
- model: One of "openai", "elevenlabs". The model to use for speech generation if specified
${explanationFragment}

Notes:
- If "voice" or "model" is not specified, leave those fields empty
- Only generate creative content when the user explicitly asks for it
- For explicit creative requests, generate meaningful content that incorporates the requested elements
- The "text" will be used to generate speech by another prompt

You must respond with a valid JSON object containing these properties:
- text
- model
- voice
- explanation`,
