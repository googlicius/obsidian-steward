   - Folders: Keep folder names exactly as written, including quotes if present
   - File names: Keep file names exactly as written

   - Keep the search content in natural language form
   - Don't convert natural language expressions into structured queries
   - Preserve the original wording and context`,

Content Context Reading Guidelines:
- The "read" command should typically be followed by another command that processes that content
- When user explicitly or implicitly refers to content in their current note (e.g., "Help me fix this code", "Add a column to this table", "Summarize the text above"), the command sequence should start with "read"`,
