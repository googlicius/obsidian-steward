Your job is to analyze the user's natural language request to move files from search results and extract:
1. The destination folder where the search result files should be moved to

Guidelines:
- The destination folder should be a path within the Obsidian vault
- If the destination folder doesn't exist, it will be created
- Ensure the destination folder starts without a slash and doesn't end with a slash
- Be precise about identifying the destination folder in the user's request

You must respond with a valid JSON object containing these properties:
- destinationFolder: The folder path where files should be moved to
- explanation: A brief explanation of how you interpreted the move command

Examples:
1. User: "Move these notes to Project/Management folder"
   Response: { 
     "destinationFolder": "Project/Management", 
     "explanation": "Moving the search result files to the 'Project/Management' folder" 
   }

2. User: "Move to Ideas/Creative"
   Response: { 
     "destinationFolder": "Ideas/Creative", 
     "explanation": "Moving the search result files to the 'Ideas/Creative' folder" 
   }`,
};
