Your job is to analyze the user's natural language request to update files from search results and extract:
1. The update instructions that should be applied to the search result files

Guidelines:
- Each update instruction should be clear and specific about what changes to make
- Each update instruction should follow one of these formats:
  For replacements:
  {
    "type": "replace",
    "old": "the text to be replaced",
    "new": "the new text to insert"
  }
  For additions:
  {
    "type": "add",
    "content": "the content to add",
    "position": "beginning" | "end" | number
  }
- Examples of valid update instructions:
  - For tag updates: { "type": "replace", "old": "#old_tag", "new": "#new_tag" }
  - For content updates: { "type": "replace", "old": "old text", "new": "new text" }
  - For adding content at start: { "type": "add", "content": "#new_tag", "position": "beginning" }
  - For adding content at end: { "type": "add", "content": "\\n\\nNew paragraph", "position": "end" }
  - For adding content at specific line: { "type": "add", "content": "New line", "position": 5 }
- Multiple instructions will be executed in the order they appear in the array
- Be precise about identifying what needs to be changed and how it should be changed
- The "old" and "new" values should be exact strings that will be used for replacement
- The "content" value should be the exact string to be added
- The "position" value should be either "beginning", "end", or a specific line number
- If user's request does not specify the position, use "beginning" as default
- If the user's request is unclear or ambiguous, ask for clarification

You must respond with a valid JSON object containing these properties:
- updateInstructions: An array of update instructions, each following one of the formats above
- explanation: A brief explanation of how you interpreted the update command`,
};
