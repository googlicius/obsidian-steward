# Obsidian Steward

Obsidian Steward is a plugin that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with your Obsidian Vault. It provides building block commands like search, move, copy, create, and more, allowing you to build sophisticated custom prompts, prompt chaining, and automation for your specific tasks.

## Features

- **Built-in Search Engine**: Powerful TF-IDF based search with relevant scoring and typo tolerance that is significantly faster than the native Obsidian search
- **Command-based Interaction**: Support for commands like search, create, update, delete, move, audio, and image generation
- **Multi-language Support**: Use Steward in your preferred language
- **Privacy-focused**: Most actions are executed in the front-end using Obsidian API to avoid exposing your data to LLMs (except for your queries)
- **Beautiful Chat UI**: Interactive chat interface that leverages Obsidian's editor support
- **Model Flexibility**: Use your favorite AI models including OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Ollama local models
- **Intent Caching**: Utilizes embeddings to cache similar queries so subsequent requests don't require LLM processing
