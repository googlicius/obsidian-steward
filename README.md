# Steward

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/googlicius/obsidian-steward/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/googlicius/obsidian-steward/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Steward is a plugin that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with your Obsidian Vault. It provides commands like `search`, `move`, `copy`, `create`, etc, as building blocks to create your own sophisticated commands, prompt chaining, and automation for your specific tasks.

## Features

- **Built-in Search Engine**: A TF-IDF based search with relevant scoring and typo tolerance that is significantly faster than the native Obsidian search
- **Command-based Interaction**: Support for standard commands like search, create, update, delete, move, audio, image generation, and user-defined commands
- **Multi-language Support**: Use Steward in your preferred language
- **Privacy-focused**: Most actions are executed in the front-end using Obsidian API to avoid exposing your data to LLMs (except for your queries)
- **Interactive Chat UI**: An interactive chat interface using your current theme that leverages Obsidian's editor features to input any supported Markdown syntax. You can start a conversation, whether in the Chat sidebar or directly in the current editor.
- **Model Flexibility**: Use your favorite AI models including OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Ollama local models
- **Intent Caching**: Utilizes embeddings to cache similar queries so subsequent requests don't require LLM processing

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Active Development** ðŸš§

This plugin is currently under active development. New features and improvements are being added regularly. While the core functionality is stable, you might encounter occasional issues or changes as development progresses. Feedback and bug reports are welcome!

## Standard (Built-In) Commands

Steward can be used through the command palette directly in the editor or by opening the chat interface. Here are some example commands:

### Command Flow Visualization

The following diagram illustrates how commands are processed in Steward:

<img src="/assets/commands-flow.svg" alt="Commands flow" width="50%">

### Usage

- **/search** Notes tagged #Todo in the root folder
- / Add tag #Done to all notes of the search results and move them to the Archived folder
- / Write a poem about Angular in a new note then move it to the Generated folder
- / Update the list above to a numbered list
- **/audio** "project" as a noun and a verb using 11Labs
- / I don't like your name, you are "Joe" from now on

### Tips to reduce the number of input tokens

- Use a specific command directly instead of a general command (`/ `), e.g, `/search`, `/audio`, etc.
- For the `/search` command, wrap the keyword in quotation marks for searching the vault without the LLM's help, e.g, `/search "my cat"`
- Create User-Defined commands
- Provide feedback by clicking thumbs up or down on any Steward's answer to help it classify accurately #Todo.

## User-Defined Commands

You can create your own **User-Defined Commands** to automate workflows and combine multiple built-in or other User-Defined commands into a single, reusable command.

### How It Works

- User-Defined Commands are defined as YAML blocks in markdown files inside the `Steward/Commands` folder.
- Each command can specify a sequence of built-in or user-defined commands to execute.
- You can specify if user input is required for your command using the `query_required` field.
- These commands are available with autocomplete and are processed just like built-in commands.

### Example: User-Defined Command YAML

```yaml
command_name: clean_up
description: Clean up the vault
query_required: false
model: gpt-4o # Optional: Specify a default model for all commands
commands:
  - name: search
    system_prompt:
      - Notes in the root folder
    query: Notes name start with Untitled
  - name: delete_from_artifact
    query: Delete them
    model: gpt-3.5-turbo # Optional: Override the model for this specific step
```

- `command_name`: The name you will use to invoke the command (e.g., `/clean_up`)
- `query_required`: (optional, boolean) If true, the command requires user input after the prefix
- `model`: (optional, string) The model to use for all commands in this user-defined command
- `commands`: The sequence of built-in or user-defined commands to execute
  - `system_prompt`: The system prompts that allows you to add additional guidelines to LLMs to the current command
  - `query`: (required if the `query_required` is true, string) The query to send to LLMs, put the `$from_user` as a placeholder for your input
  - `model`: (optional, string) The model to use for this specific command step (overrides the command-level model)

### Using Links in System Prompts

You can reference the content of other notes in your vault by using Obsidian links in the `system_prompt` array:

```yaml
command_name: search_with_context
description: Search with predefined context
query_required: true
commands:
  - name: search
    system_prompt:
      - '[[My Context Note]]'
      - Additional instructions
    query: $from_user
```

When the command is executed:

1. The link `[[My Context Note]]` will be replaced with the actual content of that note
2. This allows you to maintain complex prompts or contexts in separate notes
3. You can update the linked notes independently of your command definition

### Usage

1. Create a note in `Steward/Commands` and add your command YAML in a code block.
2. In any note or the Chat, type your command (e.g., `/clean_up #Todo`) and press Enter.
3. The command will execute the defined sequence, using your input if required.

### Validation

- The system validates your User-Defined Command YAML:
  - `command_name` must be a string
  - `commands` must be a non-empty array
  - If present, `query_required` must be a boolean
  - Each command step must have a `name` (string) and `query` (string)
- If validation fails, the command will not be loaded and an error will be logged.

### Creating Commands with LLM Assistance

You can ask Steward to help create user-defined commands using natural language, even without knowing YAML syntax:

1. Simply share the [User-Defined Command Guidelines](User-Defined%20Command%20Guidelines.md) with Steward
2. Describe what you want your command to do in plain language
3. Steward will create commands with the proper YAML structure for you
4. Review, modify if needed, and save to your Commands folder
