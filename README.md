# Steward

Steward is a plugin that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with your Obsidian Vault. It provides commands like `search`, `move`, `copy`, `create`, etc, as building blocks for building your own sophisticated commands, prompt chaining, and automation for your specific tasks.

## Features

- **Built-in Search Engine**: A TF-IDF based search with relevant scoring and typo tolerance that is significantly faster than the native Obsidian search
- **Command-based Interaction**: Support for commands like search, create, update, delete, move, audio, and image generation
- **Multi-language Support**: Use Steward in your preferred language
- **Privacy-focused**: Most actions are executed in the front-end using Obsidian API to avoid exposing your data to LLMs (except for your queries)
- **Interactive Chat UI**: An interactive chat interface using your current theme that leverages Obsidian's editor features to input any supported Markdown syntax. You can start a conversation, whether in the Chat sidebar or directly in the current editor.
- **Model Flexibility**: Use your favorite AI models including OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Ollama local models
- **Intent Caching**: Utilizes embeddings to cache similar queries so subsequent requests don't require LLM processing

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Active Development** ðŸš§

This plugin is currently under active development. New features and improvements are being added regularly. While the core functionality is stable, you might encounter occasional issues or changes as development progresses. Feedback and bug reports are welcome!

## Usage

Steward can be used through the command palette directly in the editor or by opening the chat interface. Here are some example commands:

- **/search** Notes tagged #Todo in the root folder
- / Add tag #Done to all notes of the search results and move them to the Archived folder
- / Write a poem about Angular in a new note then move it to the Generated folder
- / Update the list above to a numbered list
- **/audio** "project" as a noun and a verb using 11Labs
- / I don't like your name, you are "Joe" from now on

**Your commands (Not implemented yet):**

Load one or more custom prompts by adding tags to the command:

- / `#tagRelatedToAPrompt` Finish this

## Tips to reduce the number of input tokens

- Use a specific command directly instead of a general command (`/ `), e.g, `/search`, `/audio`, etc.
- For the `/search` command, wrap the keyword in quotation marks for searching the vault without the LLM's help, e.g, `/search "my cat"`
- Provide feedback by clicking thumbs up or down on any Steward's answer to help it classify accurately #Todo.
